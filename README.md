# CSE 2221 Software I: Software Components
Intellectual foundations of software engineering;\
Design-by-contract principles;\
Mathematical modeling of software functionality;\
Component-based software from client's perspective.

## Learning Outcomes
- Be familiar with the reasons it is important that software be "correct", i.e., why "good enough" is not good enough when it comes to software quality
- Be familiar with the reasons for designing software to minimize the impact of change, and why it is difficult to achieve this
- Be familiar with using design-by-contract principles to write software that uses existing software components based on their interface contracts
- Be familiar with using interface contracts that are described using simple predicate calculus assertions with mathematical integer, string, finite set, and tuple models
- Be familiar with extending existing software components by layering new operations on top of existing operations
- Be familiar with using simple recursion
- Be familiar with using simple techniques to test application software and layered implementations of extensions, including developing and carrying out simple specification-based test plans
- Be familiar with using simple techniques to debug application software and layered implementations of extensions
- Be exposed to using basic algorithm analysis techniques and notations to analyze and express execution times of operations whose implementations involve straight-line code and simple loops
- Be competent with writing Java programs in a procedural style using the basic control structures, primitive value types, character strings, and input/output
- Be familiar with writing Java programs using core language features including interfaces, classes, inheritance, and assertions
- Be familiar with using an understanding of the difference between value types and reference types to trace the execution of simple Java code in situations involving both flavors of types, including their use as parameters to method calls
- Be familiar with writing Java programs that use software components similar to (but simplified from) those in the Java collections framework
- Be exposed to writing Java simple programs with graphical user interfaces
- Be familiar with testing using JUnit
- Be familiar with illustrating key dependencies between software components using UML class diagrams (or similar)
- Be familiar with using the most important features of a modern IDE such as Eclipse
